Button Input Example
====================
This example demonstrates reading button input and controlling an LED.

Hardware:
- ESP8266 (Wemos D1 or D1 Mini)
- Push button connected to D5 (GPIO14)
- Optional: External LED and resistor on D6 (GPIO12)

Connections:
- Button: One side to D5, other side to GND
- LED (optional): Anode to D6 through 220Î© resistor, cathode to GND

The internal pull-up resistor is used, so button reads HIGH when not pressed.

# led = Pin(12, Pin.OUT)  # Uncomment for external LED on D6
